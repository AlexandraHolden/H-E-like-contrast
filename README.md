# H and E-like-contrast
Python code to pseudo colour CH2 and CH3 Raman images to create a H&amp;E like contrast

The code requires two input files in tiff format - a CH<sub>2</sub> image and a CH<sub>3</sub>.
The exact contrast can be edited by changing the if loop to make the image more purple or more pink.


## **HES-like contrast**
  An edited code includes the additional orange stain given by adding saffron to a normal Hematoxylin and Eosin stain. The additional colour is given by taking an image of collagen using Second Harmonic Generation.
